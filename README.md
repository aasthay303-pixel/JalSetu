# JalSetu – Smart Water Tanker Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
**JalSetu** is a frontend-based web application designed to improve the efficiency and transparency of water tanker distribution in the Mira–Bhayander region.  
The system digitizes tanker booking, allocation, and tracking to reduce delays, hoarding, and unfair distribution.

This project is developed as an **academic mini-project** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with **LocalStorage** to simulate backend functionality.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
During summer months and pipeline maintenance in Mira–Bhayander, residents heavily depend on water tankers.  
The current manual allocation system leads to:
- Delays in tanker arrival  
- No real-time tracking  
- Unfair distribution of water  
- Excessive calling to multiple vendors  

**JalSetu** solves this by providing a digital, structured, and transparent allocation system.
